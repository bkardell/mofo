# mofo

Everybody seems to be creating serialization formats, so here's mine: Mark's Object FOrmat

## Rationale

JSON is fairly lightweight, but it's still cruftier than it needs to be and doesn't handle dates or some other really useful bits properly.
MOFO reduces the cruft and does additional useful stuff (dates, binaries, typed nulls and comments).

## RFC

I didn't do CS or anything like that, so I don't know BNF; therefore, the following will be in English.

**MIME type:** `application/mofo`

### Primitives

Five basic primitive data types are supported: String, Number, Date, Boolean and Binary:

* String elements are surrounded by $, as in `$MOFO is awesome$`.
  * An actual $ symbol in a string is escaped with a backslash, as in `$Total: \$599.99$`
  * Standard special string characters are represented as usual: `\n`, `\t`, etc
  * Actual backslashes are represented by a double backslash
  * A null string is represented by `$$`
* Number elements are surrounded by #, as in `42`
  * A null number is represented by `##`
  * More explicit number types can be expressed within the delimiters using [the C/C++ numeric literal notations](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/constants/).
* Dates are surrounded by / and are in ISO 8601, as in `/2013-08-11T15:17:10Z/`
  * A null date is represented by `//`
* Boolean values are not delimited; they are represented by the single characters `^` for true and `!` for false
  * A null boolean is represented by a `?`
* Binary data is represented by non-delimited, lowercase hexadecimal digit pairs surrounded by ampersands, as in `&4d4f464f&`.
  * A null binary value is represented by `&&`

### Structured data

If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

#### Object graphs

* Object graphs are surrounded by `{` and `}`.
* Any text outside the delimiters used for primitive types and the three boolean symbols is considered to be a property name.
  * Property names may not contain the following characters: `$` `#` `/` `^` `!` `?` `&` `{` `}` `[` `]`
  * But they can contain spaces

Example:
````
{First name$Douglas$Last name$Adams$Date of birth/1952-03-11/}
````

#### Object graph schema

The shape of an object graph can be expressed using *Brian's Awesomely Descriptive And Short Schema for MOFO* (suggested by Brian Kardell):
````
{First name$Last name$Date of birth/}
````

To specify a boolean in a schema, use the `?` null signifier.

To indicate that a property may be of any type, use `*`.

#### Embedding BADASS

To include a BADASS declaration within a MOFO object, enclose it in parentheses `()`

Example:
````
{Class$Person$Schema({First name$Last name$Date of birth/Address{House$Street$City$Region$Postcode$Country$}})}
````

#### Lists

* Lists are surrounded by [ and ]
* Elements within lists are naturally delimited
  * Consecutive elements of the same type are split by a single instance of that type's delimiter

Examples:
* Numbers: `[#0#1#1#2#3#5#8#13#21#]`
* Strings: `[$Alice$Bob$Charlie$$Eve$]` (The `$$` represents a null element)
* Dates: `[/1970-01-01/1601-01-01/]`
* Booleans: `[^^^!!?^!]`
* Mixed (string, string, number, boolean, date, null string): `[$Alice$Bob$#42#^/1752-09-14/$$]`

### Whitespace

Whitespace outside the `$` string delimiters and not within a property name is ignored.

### Summary

This JSON:

````
{
  "Name": "Phoenix",
  "Chassis": "Titan V",
  "Drive": "Warp",
  "First launch": "5th April 2063",
  "Thumbnail": ???,
  "Real": false,
  "Crew": [ "Cochrane", "Riker", "La Forge" ]
}
````
  
Is equivalent to this MOFO:

````
{Name$Phoenix$Chassis$Titan V$Drive$Warp$First launch/2063-04-05/Real!Thumbnail&94a2f19094213a6f8241a9408266f957&Crew[$Cochrane$Riker$La Forge$]}
````

Which, since whitespace is insignificant, could also be formatted thusly:

````
{
  Name $Phoenix$ 
  Chassis $Titan V$
  Drive $Warp$
  First launch /2063-04-05/
  Real !
  Thumbnail &94a2f19094213a6f8241a9408266f957&
  Crew [$Cochrane$Riker$La Forge$]
  ©© 
     And it can have comments...
     Comments: Do you speak them MOFO?
     Yes, yes I do.
  ©©
}
````

BADASS/MOFO Schema:

````
{Name$Chassis$Drive$First launch/Real?Thumbnail&Crew[$]}
````

**Best. Wire format. Ever.**
